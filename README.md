My name is Adan Hernandez.
I am a senior Computer Engineering student, soon to be graduate.
I graduate Spring of May 2017 from the institution of California State Long Beach.
My hobbies include listening to indie rock music, going to concerts, running, visiting museums
of all types, and eating.
My goals in life are to learn as much as i can about the computer science/computer engineering
world, learn to speak different languages, run a marathon, strive to become a helpful
human being in this fast paced world, and help my family as much as i can.
